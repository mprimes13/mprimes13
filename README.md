Welcome to the Projects Collection of Mychael Primes!

Here, you'll find serveral web-based applications and games, using as many of the latest APIs, Game Engines, Frameworks, and so on.
These will include (but aren't limited to) Unity3D, Unreal Engine 3/4, Node/React/Angular/Ext.js, HTML5, CSS, Wordpress, and Python 2/3.

Many of these apps/games will use open-sourced/free-to-use content, and may have additional features available to them, such as SQL databases and multiplayer servers/secure p2p connections.

This repository serves as a demonstration of my professional and hobbyist knowledge in the market of Computer Science, Software and Web Application Development, Game Development and Design, and Database Administration.
